# fractals-playground

A tour in the wonderland of deterministic, random and natural fractals with python.

Fractals are patterns that are generated by repeating themselves.

They are recursive i.e. starting with a simple rule that is replicated at every level of the fractal. Fractals can be infinitely complex, yet created from a simple rule.

The long term plan for this project is to be open source so that people can add more and more beautiful fractals to the mix. I'd like everybody to play and potentially build their own little toy in the playground.

## Contributing

There are two main ways to contribute - improving the existing fractals or adding new ones.
